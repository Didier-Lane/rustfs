## Host

The `host` [dependency] is responsible for providing host system informations such as the OS name, the processor architecture and the `BIN_DIR` [environment variable], it is controlled by the [make/deps/host.mk] Makefile.

Because it is a [special dependency], you don't necessary have to enable it manually unless it is the only [dependency] you require.
